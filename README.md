-  Hi, I’m @svnlvs :]
-  I’m interested in reading/writing, drawing, singing, acting, sleeping, and playing games
-  I’m currently learning things about mental health!
-  I like Harry Potter, Breaking Bad, GOT, Heartstopper, Westworld, and The Mummy (1999), black cats, ramen noodles, and music
-  I dislike people who romanticize mental health, people who are rude for no reason, and people who don't know the difference between "you're" and "your"
-  Pronouns: He/They
-  Fun fact: Yo mama
